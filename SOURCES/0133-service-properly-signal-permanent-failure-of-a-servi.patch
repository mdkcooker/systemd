Subject: [PATCH 133/204] service: properly signal permanent failure of a
 service to its socket

This makes sure that a service is not indefinitely restarted in a tight
loop if it fails before it is able to process its socket.

This corrects the breakage introduced with
8d1b002a2e389e79a2414491523de549783abf73. Shame on me.
(cherry picked from commit 464876c9c410b2f5bb997259510a13d0ee7d0af0)
