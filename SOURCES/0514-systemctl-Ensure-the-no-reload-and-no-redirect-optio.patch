Subject: [PATCH 514/514] systemctl: Ensure the --no-reload and --no-redirect
 options are passed to chkconfig

We want to ensure that chkconfig won't create any circular loops incase
it mistakenly things we're in control. Thus the --no-redirect argument
is a good safety net.

The --no-reload prevents a very strange case where the the shelled
out chkconfig will trigger a systemd daemon-reload (by itself shelling
out to systemctl) and then we also reload ourselves very shortly after
and this causes systemd to get into a very strange state whereby it
basically crashes (I suspect a serialisation race of some kind) and
as one of the symptoms it writes out a /run/nologin file which is
what most people notice.

A patch has been added to chkconfig to add the --no-reload behaviour.
